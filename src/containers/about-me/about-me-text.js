// "Game development is my jam, especially gameplay, graphics/animation, tool creation, and procedural generation. My strongest suits are problem solving, attention to detail, cross-discipline communication, and designing for and anticipating designersâ€™ needs.",
// "I have professional experience in gameplay and systems programming. I've worked on 2 live service games, one of those from start to ship, and have helped prototype several others. I'm always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities, and hope to one day lead my own game studio.",
